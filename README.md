## Introducing Deduction!

A full-stack web app created with the use of React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Supabase, and OpenAI, Deduction is the game where you test your AI-deduction skills!
Choose between three different modes: quotes, pictures, and music and determine which piece of media is either real or completely AI-generated!

## Inspiration:

The inspiration for this app came from a long conversation with a friend about the future of generative AI and how over time, generative AI is creating more realistic photos and videos that can easily fool various people.
Considering we ended that conversation with general concern over how advanced generative AI is getting, I created this personal project as a way to not only improve AI-literacy for users, but also make the process of recognizing AI-generated works from
real human-created media fun!

Additionally, as I began my degree in Computer Science, I wanted to get better at web development. After jumping into a few hackathons and taking a few web dev courses on Udemy, I decided to challenge myself
and create my first personal project on my own. Much of the tech stack used in this first project are technologies I recently learned how to use or learned throughout the process of developing this app!

## Tech Stack:

For front-end, Deduction utilizes a React library with components styled with CSS. For the back-end, a Supabase database was used to store the different types of data needed to create questions.
Additionally, for the quote mode, the OpenAI API is leveraged to create AI-generated quotes that are then sent to the Supabase database. 
Currently, picture and music mode are works in progress, and as such, appropriate APIs will be integrated into the future.

## The Future of Deduction:

This app is currently a work-in-progress. More features, such as animations, improved UI, the pictures and music modes, will be added in the future, ideally before April 2025. 
A demo video as well as directions on how to run the app on your device will eventually come soon as well!
